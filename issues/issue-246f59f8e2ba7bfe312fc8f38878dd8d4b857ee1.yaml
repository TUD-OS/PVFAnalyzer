title: "Register analysis: heuristic for determining vulnerability *type*"
desc: |-
  Pure register analysis only allows us to determine _when_ to inject a fault, but we still require FI runs to actually determine the outcome.
  
  Heuristics may help here:
    - if a register is used to compute a memory address, perform a jump etc.,
      it is most likely to lead to a crash
    - if a register is solely used for computation and ends up e.g., as a system
      call parameter, it is more likely to lead to SDC
