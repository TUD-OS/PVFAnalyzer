title: "Register analysis: tainting"
desc: |-
  Registers are not independent from each other. Data written to one register is later used in an operation writing to another one. Therefore, these values depend on each other.
  Use taint analysis to model these dependencies.

    Use cases:
    - memory access analysis: figure out if a certain register error is more likely to lead to silent data corruption or to a crash
    - identify values that are used in a long chain of register accesses and hence more likely w.r.t. errors (data profiling)
