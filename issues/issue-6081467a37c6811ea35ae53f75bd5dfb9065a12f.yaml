  - |-
    breakpoint set/reset works now.
    
    Next steps:
    - integrate with CFGBuilder
      - discover new address -> find if BB is already in CFG
      - if yes: add edge
      - if no: start new partial BB discovery
      - in both cases: adapt edge types in CFG
        and write CFG back to file
    - trace generation: instrument all jumps with more than one
      successor and track when which path is taken -> generate iList
