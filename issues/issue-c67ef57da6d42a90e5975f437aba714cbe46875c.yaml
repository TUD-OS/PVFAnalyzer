title: Register modification table
desc: |-
  For every instruction, we need information about which of its operands are read/written and which other registers are affected.
  
  Thus, we need a table:
  
  <instr> -> OP1.desc, OP2.desc, OP3.desc, EIP.desc, FLAGS.desc
  where desc := { r, w }
  
  Later versions might even provide bit-wise access information.
