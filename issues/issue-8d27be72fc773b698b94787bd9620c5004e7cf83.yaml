title: "PVF Analysis: handle commonly known false positives (e.g., xor REG, REG)"
desc: |-
  "xor REG,REG" seems to read from its input register and write to the output. This would mean that REG was important previously and gets written to now.
  
  However, for the example where REG == REG, this is simply a write to the register and we should ignore the read, because any previous content is overwritten regardless.
